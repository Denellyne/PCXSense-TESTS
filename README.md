# PCXSense Updater

Updates PCXSense automatically at startup

# Regarding Virus Detection

Because an autoupdater and a trojan do somewhat the same thing this is detected as a virus, as such whitelist this if your device detected it as one, I sent a sample to Microsoft and MalwareBytes and MalwareBytes confirmed it was a false positive

Proof: [Malwarebytes Confirms its a false Positive](https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/307011-false-positive-on-my-autoupdater/)

Sorry for any inconvenience
